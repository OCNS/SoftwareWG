# Software WG: Home

This repository is used for housekeeping by the INCF/OCNS Software Working Group (WG) and its website.

For discussions on activities, please refer to [Latest Institutions/OCNS topics - Neurostars](https://neurostars.org/c/institutions/ocns/30).

## Setup

This website uses the [Pelican static website generator](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/).
To obtain the sources, please clone the repository recursively to ensure that included git submodule repositories are also cloned.
You will then need to have the Python packages listed in `requirements.txt` installed (preferably in a virtual environment).
The `bulrush` theme also requires the installation of the `less` node module: `npm install less`.
Please see the [Bulrush theme documentation](https://github.com/textbook/bulrush/tree/master) for more information.

The website is published on GitHub pages, using `ghp-import`.
