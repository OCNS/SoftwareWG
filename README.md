This repository is used for housekeeping by the INCF/OCNS Software Working Group (WG) and its website.

For discussions on activities, please refer to [Latest Institutions/OCNS topics - Neurostars](https://neurostars.org/c/institutions/ocns/30).

## Setup

This website uses the [Pelican static website generator](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/) along with our fork of the  [Pelican-Alchemy theme](https://github.com/OCNS/pelican-alchemy).
To obtain the sources, please clone the repository recursively to ensure that included git submodule repositories are also cloned.
You will then need to have the Python packages listed in `requirements.txt` installed (preferably in a virtual environment).

The website is published on GitHub pages, using `ghp-import`.
