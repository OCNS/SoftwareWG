Minutes

Tutorial survey form
=====================

We've been working on the tutorials survey form.
This is a work in progress, and the discussion can be seen on this GitHub ticket:

https://github.com/OCNS/SoftwareWG/issues/57

It is expected to be sent out to various mailing lists early next week, and the results to be discussed at the next WG progress meeting.

CNS 2022 tutorials
===================

Tutorials at CNS*2022 have been `announced <https://www.cnsorg.org/cns-2022-call-for-tutorials>`__, with the submission deadline on 15th of April.
We discussed what tutorials we, the working group, can organise.

- Malin will speak to Fleur about topics/syllabus for the tutorial.
- An idea is to keep tutorials tool agnostic, and then feed into different simulator specific tutorials.

  - For example: HH tutorial in Python: https://hodgkin-huxley-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

- Neuromatch Academy (NMA) probably happen in July again: https://academy.neuromatch.io/
- We need to figure out what it is we want to teach before we can come up with a syllabus and assign tasks.

  - Ideally, we want to find a sweet spot that avoids both generic computational neuroscience teaching and generic tool basics.
- A repeat of last year's tutorials may be acceptable.


Additionally:

- We discussed setting up a resource that lists various tools and their use cases/features. The aim is to give users a quick way to find the appropriate tool for their task.
- There's the NeuroTech mind map, and we should add a tools section to the CompNeuro bits:

WG diversity
============

- https://github.com/OCNS/SoftwareWG/issues/58
- We will reach out to neuroscience groups on Discord and Reddit and get some of the members involved in OCNS to increase our diversity.

  - We could try to recruit from computational neuroscience communities with more diversity, like Neuromatch.
  - `Outreachy <https://www.outreachy.org/>`__: where we can get stipends for candidates from the Wellcome Trust.
  - Brainhack, and *all* other communities that we can connect with.

INCF Assembly workshop
=======================

https://www.incf.org/blog/call-incf-assembly-workshop-themes

- Idea: adopt some of the existing ideas and best practices in DevOps to Neuroscience data life cycle
- propose birds of a feather sessions

  - diversity and inclusion
  - tool developers in neuroscience
  - education/training

- the INCF training weeks will happen separately for specific training sessions

Since the meeting, we have submitted two workshop proposals to the INCF Assembly:

- A session on increasing diversity and inclusion in Neuroscience/Neuroinformatics.
- A session showcasing software used in Neuroscience.
