The abstract for the talk is below:

Today, software is a key part of almost all research, and the development and
maintenance of this software is done by human beings, often in academia. It's
essential that these activities be seen as a valued element of scholarly work
so that the people who do it have career paths that encourage them to continue
to do it. One means of accomplishing this is to use the existing scholarly
citation system.

The `FORCE11 Software Citation working group
<https://www.force11.org/group/software-citation-working-group>`__ developed a
set of `Software Citation Principles in 2016
<https://www.force11.org/software-citation-principles>`__, and since then, the
`FORCE11 Software Citation Implementation working group
<https://www.force11.org/group/software-citation-implementation-working-group>`__
has been working with many types of stakeholders, including publishers,
repositories, and standards, to implement the principles.  We'll talk about
this work, the changes we've seen, what still needs to be done, and how the
INCF community can participate.
