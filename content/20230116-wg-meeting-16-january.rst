Agenda
=======

https://github.com/OCNS/SoftwareWG/issues/120

- task force updates
- ideas for sessions (dev sessions, hightlights etc.)
- initial discussion on whether or not we want to host satellite tutorials along with (before?) CNS*2023 (the conference is in Leipzig from July 15-19)
- tasks from last meeting (no pending tasks from last meeting)

Task force updates
-------------------

Guidelines task force
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- unsure of scope at the moment
- ACTION: Chitaranjan set up new doodle to plan next meeting: meeting in week starting 30 January to allow time for doodle filling

Simulator selection resource
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- consolidated updates document: https://hackmd.io/LWjtz9ykQbm7yg5X_RKpCQ?view
- progress on scope
- progress on inclusion criteria
- progress on "front end" design
- focus more on information useful to user/newcomer rather than technical information/criteria
- regular meeting schedule: alternate Wednesdays on 14 UTC. Next meeting is 25th January at 1400 UTC
- 4-5 regular task force members (more are always welcome!)

Ideas for sessions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- ACTION: Ankur e-mail list asking for ideas
- ACTION: Marcel e-mail Dendrify devs about software hightlight/dev session and CC Ankur/Shailesh (https://github.com/OCNS/SoftwareWG/issues/93) (DONE)

Initial discussion on Satellite tutorials at CNS 2023
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

https://www.cnsorg.org/

- 2022: https://ocns.github.io/SoftwareWG/pages/software-wg-satellite-tutorials-at-cns-2022.html
- unsure if people are interested in live teaching sessions when they can go through documentation/videos/notebooks at their own pace when required
- if we do a repeat of last year, we will charge a small registration fee to filter out people that are registering for meetings but not necessarily attending: it will be a small fee, that can be waived without requiring documentation (similar to Neuromatch conferences)
- we will use something like `Sched <https://sched.com>`__ to ensure regular reminders are sent to registrants
- we will ask either INCF/OCNS to fund us, and they get whatever registration fees are collected in return
- alternatives

  - software wg open day with a mix of user and dev focussed sessions, open to everyone to attend
  - short software highlights some time before the conference to give people an idea of the tools (and what to expect from tutorials at CNS): open to everyone
  - reproduction projects:

    - tutors (tool devs) list some models that they would like reproduced in their simulators
    - "students" work with them to reproduce them
    - submit to rescience
    - Issue: probably not doable in a day, so if done, will be a longer term project requiring multiple meetings

- internships
  - usually require some buy in from institutions, so not easy to do

- ACTION: Ankur put all this in a GitHub issue for discussion
- ACTION: Ankur e-mail tutors from last year to see what they think and what they are ready to do
