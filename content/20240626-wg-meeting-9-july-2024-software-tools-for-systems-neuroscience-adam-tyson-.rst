Understanding the brain requires processing and analysing large, multidimensional datasets.
Systems neuroscience, in particular, has undergone a drastic transformation, with individual labs now commonly generating terabytes or even petabytes of data annually.
While there has been an increase in software tools to process this data, many of these tools are single-purpose, inadequately maintained, or poorly integrated with the broader software ecosystem.
This talk will outline some of the tools we are developing for `computational neuroanatomy <https://brainglobe.info/>`__, `video behavioural analysis <https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev/>`__, and `data management <https://neuroblueprint.neuroinformatics.dev/>`__.

About the speaker:

Adam Tyson is the Head Research Engineer at the `Sainsbury Wellcome Centre <https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/>`__ and `Gatsby Computational Neuroscience <https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/gatsby-computational-neuroscience-unit>`__ Unit at University College London.
He established the `Neuroinformatics Unit <https://neuroinformatics.dev/>`__, a research software engineering team dedicated to developing robust, maintainable, and user-friendly software tools for neuroscience and machine learning.
Adam completed a PhD in neuroscience at Kingâ€™s College London before working as a software developer at the Institute of Cancer Research and the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre.
