- We have a chat room on `Matrix/Element <https://matrix.to/#/#OCNS_SoftwareWG:gitter.im>`__ where we hang out. It is also bridged to a `room on Gitter <https://gitter.im/OCNS/SoftwareWG>`__.
- We use `GitHub discussions <https://github.com/OCNS/SoftwareWG/discussions>`__ as our primary discussion channel. `Say hello! <https://github.com/OCNS/SoftwareWG/discussions/12>`__.
- We are also reachable at the `OCNS category on Neurostars <https://neurostars.org/c/institutions/ocns/30>`__.
- Both WG chairs are also reachable at the OCNS Webmaster's e-mail address at `webmaster AT cnsorg.org`.


The primary mode of communication for the WG will remain on Neurostars.
However, the regular developer sessions will be supplemented with virtual WG meetings to allow our global membership to communicate with each other.

Since the WG is shared by the INCF_ and OCNS_ organisations, we request that all members of the WG ensure that they are members of either of these organisations also.
