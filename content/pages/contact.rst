- We have a chat room on `Matrix/Element <https://matrix.to/#/#OCNS_Softwareworking group:gitter.im>`__ where we hang out. It is also bridged to a `room on Gitter <https://gitter.im/OCNS/Softwareworking group>`__.
- We use `GitHub discussions <https://github.com/OCNS/Softwareworking group/discussions>`__ as our primary discussion channel. `Say hello! <https://github.com/OCNS/Softwareworking group/discussions/12>`__.
- We are also reachable at the `OCNS category on Neurostars <https://neurostars.org/c/institutions/ocns/30>`__.
- Both working group chairs are also reachable at the OCNS Webmaster's e-mail address at `webmaster AT cnsorg.org`.

The primary mode of communication for the working group will remain on Neurostars.
However, the regular developer sessions will be supplemented with virtual working group meetings to allow our global membership to communicate with each other.

Since the working group is shared by the INCF_ and OCNS_ organisations, we request that all members of the working group ensure that they are members of either of these organisations also.

Meetings
--------

From January 2022, the working group will meet regularly on the second Monday of each month, with the time of the meeting alternating between 1700 UTC and 0800 UTC to allow members from different time zones to attend.
The agenda is collected on `GitHub tickets <https://github.com/OCNS/SoftwareWG/labels/C%3A%20Meeting>`__, and we meet on `Jitsi <https://meet.jit.si/moderated/27ddeaff25933944fea1937f182235d48de7c2dd59dc2f84f8eebb26a8fc07ab>`__.
Please feel free to drop in.
