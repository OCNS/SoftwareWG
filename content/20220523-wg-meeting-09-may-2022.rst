Minutes

CNS * 2022 satellite tutorials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- OCNS have no objections with sessions being repeated at online satellite tutorials.
- ACTION: Ankur ping Elephant again: https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/elephant/issues/484: **DONE**
- ACTION: Ankur ping Neurolib again: https://github.com/OCNS/SoftwareWG/issues/77: **DONE**
- ACTION: Ankur ping Eden again: https://github.com/OCNS/SoftwareWG/issues/95: **DONE**
- ACTION: Ankur/Shailesh: update text on the website to say "as part of CNS" instead of "at CNS": https://ocns.github.io/SoftwareWG/pages/software-wg-satellite-tutorials-at-cns-2022.html: **DONE**
- ACTION: move July meeting(s) to first week: Avoid July 4, Holiday in US: **DONE** (moved a week earlier to July 06)
- ACTION: introduce WG in all satellite sessions: request presenters to do a quick blurb on WG to start with: **NOTED**

- Based on the `survey results <https://github.com/OCNS/SoftwareWG/issues/82>`__, we decided to do another session on containers:

  - NEW session: Ankur: Containers 101 : 1.5 hours: Ticket opened: https://github.com/OCNS/SoftwareWG/issues/96
  - start by showing traditional Python virtual environment development method to show advantages of using a container based workflow:

    - pulling images
    - creating images (including files from local file system)
    - accessing local file system from container
    - list of comp-neuro containers (NeuralEnsemble/NEST/NeuroFedora/etc.): ask everyone presenting a tutorial if they have container images
    - set up web page for this on our website with initial information: people need to have docker/podman installed
    - mention `Toolbx <https://containertoolbx.org/>`__.

- We went through the survey results to see what other sessions we could add to our satellite tutorials, (if we have slots):

  - Keras (3 hours)

    - ACTION: Ankur reach out to Cecilia Jarne: DONE
    - https://github.com/OCNS/SoftwareWG/issues/97

  - Catch22 (3 hours max?)
  - Datalad (1.5 hours)
  - PyNN (3 hours max)
  - Fasttrack: less priority as does not fit comp-neuro theme

- Other tools in the survey:

  - Missingno + Pingouin + general analysis visualisation tools: maybe a tutorial later in the year
  - MorphIO/MorphTool/NeuroM: session later in the year
  - NWB ecosystem: do lots of user days themselves, we can do a specific tutorial later in the year
  - NiPy suite: also better to do a specific tutorial later in the year
  - PETlink: skip for now, not comp-neuro
  - PyElectro: with NeuroML bits
  - PyBIDS: maybe neuroimaging tutorial later
  - PySpike: separate tutorial later in the year (correct typo elsewhere also: spike not spyke)
  - Spiking circus: later (spike train analysis tutorial?)
  - Allen tools, BMTK: full day tutorial later on
  - BrainScaleS + Spinnaker: reach out for tutorial later (needs access to hardware)
  - GENESIS?
  - SciUnit/NeuronUnit: tutorial later
  - STEPS: dedicated tutorial later

- ACTION: Ankur re-ping Thomas Nowotny about sending out the survey in next communication (check if it has been sent out yet), if no newsletter: being sent out in newsletter, so not required: **DONE**
- ACTION: Shailesh ping newsletter organisers (tentative newsletter in May): **DONE**
- ACTION: Ankur/Shailesh check if it was included in the INCF newsletter: was in issue 1: **DONE**

- ACTION: reach out to confirmed tutorials to ask for (**WIP**):

  - Duration (give slot options)
  - preferred time
  - web page link for session
  - whether they need us to set up zoom meetings for them (preferable that they handle this themselves)
  - strongly suggest recording (especially if there isn't a recording of their tutorial already): we will get these uploaded to the training space
  - DEADLINE for confirmation: 20th (2 weeks)

- ACTION: end of next week (20th) send out e-mail to public lists about satellite tutorials ("save the date" with initial information)
- ACTION: Ankur drop comment on https://github.com/OCNS/SoftwareWG/issues/61 for ideas, if none, close next meeting: **DONE**
- ACTION: Ankur: same for https://github.com/OCNS/SoftwareWG/issues/62: **DONE**
