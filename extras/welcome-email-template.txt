Dear <new member>

Thanks for your interest in the INCF/OCNS Software Working group.
Welcome!

The group is designed to be open to all, so there isn't any real formal
on-boarding process. Since most of our members tend to use GitHub quite
a bit, we use GitHub for issues/discussion and other
organisation tasks. So, we have a GitHub team here:
https://github.com/orgs/OCNS/teams/software-wg/members

and multiple repositories under the OCNS organization account:
- https://github.com/OCNS/SoftwareWG
- https://github.com/OCNS/SoftwareWG-events

If you could please tell us your GitHub username, we'll send you the
team invite. The next step would be to introduce yourself to the community
on this GitHub discussion:
https://github.com/OCNS/SoftwareWG/discussions/12

Finally, we need to add you to the list of members on the website. So could you
please send us the information you'd like listed there:
https://ocns.github.io/SoftwareWG/pages/members.html

It's just a static GitHub pages website, so you can even open a PR yourself
if you'd like. The source for the page is here:
https://github.com/OCNS/SoftwareWG/blob/main/content/pages/members.rst

That's pretty much it in terms of membership :)

Please do let us know if there's anything else we can help with. If you
have any ideas for tasks/projects the WG should undertake please just
start a new discussion on our GitHub repository and folks will chime in.
